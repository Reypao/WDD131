                <h2>What are Sprinkler Repairs?</h2>
                <p>Sprinkler repairs encompass a broad range of services aimed at restoring your sprinkler system to its optimal functionality. This could involve fixing a broken part, recalibrating sprinkler heads, or replacing damaged pipes. Here are some of the common sprinkler problems:
                    
                    Broken or Leaking Pipes: Often caused by lawn equipment or root growth, broken pipes can lead to water wastage and uneven irrigation.
                    Misaligned Sprinkler Heads: This can result in over-watering some areas while leaving others parched.
                    Clogged Nozzles: Dirt and debris can block sprinkler heads, reducing their efficiency.
                    Faulty Timers: An irrigation system that doesn’t start or stop as scheduled can lead to water wastage..</p>
